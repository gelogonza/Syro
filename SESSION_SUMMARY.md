- **NEXT_STEPS.md** - Prioritized implementation roadmap
- **FUTURE_FEATURES.md** - Feature ideas with effort estimates

### 4. Codebase Analysis

#### Findings Summary
- **Total Code:** 3,427 lines Python + 23 HTML templates
- **Models:** 11 core models covering music, playback, statistics
- **Views:** 4 view files (views.py, api_views.py, playback_views.py, search_views.py)
- **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS + Iconify Icons (CDN-only)

#### Strengths Identified
- Well-structured Django app with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive data models for music, playback, and statistics
- Multiple view types (HTML, REST API, AJAX endpoints)
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Spotify integration with OAuth and token management
- Feature-rich (player, search, playlists, stats, wrapped)
- Beautiful dark theme with animations

#### Critical Issues Found
1. `.env` in git (mitigated with .env.example)
2. 35 markdown files (30+ archived)
3. Inline CSS/JS in templates (identified for refactoring)
4. No static files management (CDN-only)
5. 47KB player.html (needs splitting)

#### Medium Issues Found
1. View separation unclear (4 separate files)
2. Template organization (23 in single folder)
3. Code duplication in search logic
4. Missing database migration cleanup
