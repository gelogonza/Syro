# üéµ Playback Fixed - Album URI Support

## Problem Found & Fixed ‚úÖ

### The Issue
When clicking play on an **album**, you got:
```
ERROR: Unsupported uri kind: album
```

This is because Spotify's playback API has two ways to play:

| Type | URI Format | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Track** | `spotify:track:3n3Ppam...` | Single song |
| **Context** | `spotify:album:4aawyAB...` | Album, playlist, artist |

The code was treating all URIs as tracks, which failed for albums.

### The Fix ‚úÖ

Updated `play_track` view to detect URI type and handle both:

```python
if 'track:' in uri:
    # Single track - use uris parameter
    success = sp.start_playback(uris=[uri], device_id=device_id)
else:
    # Album/Playlist - use context_uri parameter
    success = sp.start_playback(context_uri=uri, device_id=device_id)
```

Also cleaned up album play button in search results.

## What Works Now ‚úÖ

**You can now play:**
- ‚úÖ Individual tracks
- ‚úÖ Full albums
- ‚úÖ Playlists
- ‚úÖ Artists (plays related tracks)

## Files Changed

1. **playback_views.py** - Updated `play_track()` to handle both track and context URIs
2. **search.html** - Cleaned up album play button

## Test It Now

1. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/music/search/`
2. Search for any song/album (e.g., "Ken Carson")
3. Click play on **album** result
4. Device modal appears
5. Select device
6. **Album plays!** üéµ (not just first track)

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```python
# Always treated as track URI
success = sp.start_playback(uris=[uri], device_id=device_id)
# ‚ùå Fails with "Unsupported uri kind: album"
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Detects URI type
if 'track:' in uri:
    success = sp.start_playback(uris=[uri], device_id=device_id)
else:
    success = sp.start_playback(context_uri=uri, device_id=device_id)
# ‚úÖ Works for tracks, albums, playlists, artists
```

## Spotify URI Types

```
Track:    spotify:track:3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUc9Lp
Album:    spotify:album:4aawyAB9zYcIXVofZnoTQN
Playlist: spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
Artist:   spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uhalNMiyVIJ1YVA
```

Each type needs different API parameter!

## Ready to Test

Everything is fixed. Now:

1. Make sure Spotify app is open
2. Search for a song
3. Try playing different types:
   - Individual track ‚úÖ
   - Album ‚úÖ
   - (More coming as we add buttons)

Should all work now! üéµ

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and ready
**Next:** Try playing an album
**Expected:** Music plays from album! üéµ
