## Making Your First Change

1. **Pick a task** from [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md)
2. **Create a branch:** `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Make changes** following [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style-guidelines)
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Commit with clear message** (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages))
6. **Push to GitHub**

## Common Tasks

### Test the app
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Run tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Create database backup
```bash
cp db.sqlite3 db.sqlite3.backup
```

### Update documentation
Edit the relevant .md file and commit

### Add a new feature
1. Add model if needed in `models.py`
2. Add view in appropriate `*_views.py`
3. Add template in `templates/syromusic/`
4. Add URL in `urls.py`
5. Update documentation

## Asking Questions

When you get stuck:

1. **Check documentation first** - Most answers are in the docs
2. **Review similar code** - Look at similar features for examples
3. **Check Django docs** - django.readthedocs.io
4. **Check error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
5. **Read the code comments** - Developers left hints

## Performance Tips

- Don't fetch more than you need
- Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()`
- Cache Spotify API results
- Minimize database queries
- Use pagination for large lists

## Security Reminders

- Never commit `.env` file
- Always escape user input
- Use Django's CSRF protection
- Validate file uploads
- Never log sensitive data
- Keep dependencies updated

## Next Milestone

**Goal:** Implement 1-2 features from [FUTURE_FEATURES.md](FUTURE_FEATURES.md) in the next 1-2 weeks

**Suggested Priority:**
1. **Week 1:** Lyrics Display (quick win)
2. **Week 2:** MP3 Upload (high impact)
