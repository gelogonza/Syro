## üêõ If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Is Spotify Running?
```
Your device must have Spotify open!

‚úÖ Do this:
  - Open Spotify app on your computer
  - Or open Spotify on your phone
  - OR both

‚ùå Don't do this:
  - Just closed Spotify
  - Spotify running in background but paused
```

### Check 2: Is Spotify Connected?
```
‚úÖ Spotify is connected when:
  - App shows "Now Playing: ..." at top
  - You can see your username
  - Device shows in your device list

‚ùå Spotify is NOT connected when:
  - App is open but shows offline
  - Says "Connect to Spotify"
  - Device not in device list
```

### Check 3: Browser Console Errors
```
Press F12 to open Developer Tools
Click "Console" tab
Look for red error messages

Common errors and fixes:
- "CSRF token missing" ‚Üí Refresh page, try again
- "No active device" ‚Üí Open Spotify on a device
- "401 Unauthorized" ‚Üí Reconnect to Spotify
```

### Check 4: Check Django Logs
```
Look at Django server output in terminal:

‚ùå If you see:
  ERROR HTTP Error for PUT to https://api.spotify.com/...
  Player command failed: No active device found

‚úÖ Then:
  - Open Spotify on a device
  - Try playing again

If error persists after opening Spotify:
  - Go back to Step 1 (disconnect/reconnect)
```
